Aims
This project aims to develop and evaluate the performance of four machine learning algorithms—K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN), Random Forest (RF), Logistic Regression (LR), and Naive Bayes (NB)—for predicting diabetes. By comparing these methods, the goal is to identify the most effective predictive models. Additionally, the project explores the relationship between lifestyle factors and diabetes to provide valuable insights for healthcare professionals.

Expected Outcomes
We aim to enhance diabetes prediction by using a larger, more diverse dataset (BRFSS 2015). By evaluating K-NN, RF, LR, and NB, we expect to achieve higher accuracy and make the predictions more applicable to a broader population. Ultimately, the project seeks to improve diabetes detection and offer insights into lifestyle factors that influence the condition.
