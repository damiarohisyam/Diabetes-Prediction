## Project Title 

Diabetes Prediction Using Data Mining Technique

## Aims

This project aims to develop and evaluate the performance of four machine learning algorithms—K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN), Random Forest (RF), Logistic Regression (LR), and Naive Bayes (NB)—for predicting diabetes. By comparing these methods, the goal is to identify the most effective predictive models. Additionally, the project explores the relationship between lifestyle factors and diabetes to provide valuable insights for healthcare professionals.

## Dataset

The domain of the dataset is healthcare, focusing on predicting the outcomes of diabetes status in individuals. It is sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, comprising 253,680 instances and encompassing 21 features. This dataset
offers healthcare statistics, lifestyle survey information, and diagnostic data, representing responses to the CDC's 2015 survey conducted through the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS), a health survey in the United States.

The dataset is sourced from: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/891/cdc+diabetes+health+indicators.

## Expected Outcomes
We aim to enhance diabetes prediction by using a larger, more diverse dataset (BRFSS 2015). By evaluating K-NN, RF, LR, and NB, we expect to achieve higher accuracy and make the predictions more applicable to a broader population. Ultimately, the project seeks to improve diabetes detection and offer insights into lifestyle factors that influence the condition.
